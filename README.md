# UofA IEEE Git Workshop

This page serves as the information presented for the UofA IEEE Git workshop.

Follow along and I hope you learn something!

This is a guide that's meant to be followed along. There are a lot of codes blocks here, and any line that starts with `$` is something that you are meant to execute.

```bash
$ This is a command to run in your terminal
# This is a comment
```
